/-- A depth-first traversal of the graph starting at `sources`. Nodes on the same "level" of the traversal are visited in order of the edges added.
    `visit` is a function executed at each vertex, its parameters are the vertex ID and the current state, it should return a new state and
    a boolean which terminates the traversal if true (but it will still leave the node). The optional parameter `leave` is executed when the node is left,
    when all its successors have been visited, uses the same state.
    Please provide a starting state. See example uses in `Graph.TraverseExample`. -/

/-- A breadth-first traversals of the graph starting at the `sources` in order, sources should not contain duplicates. Each vertex is only visited at most once.
    Nodes on the same "level" of the traversal will be visited in random order. If you need the order to be fixed then have a look at `breadthFirstTraverseDeprecated`.
    `visit` is a function executed at each vertex, its parameters are the vertex ID and the current state, it should return a new state and a boolean which terminates
    the traversal if true. Please provide a starting state. `maxDepth` is an optional parameter you can use to limit the depth of the traversal.
